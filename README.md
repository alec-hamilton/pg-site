# Pleasure Gallery Website

Pleasure gallery is a static website project that I created in my free time outside of iO Academy. This gave me the opportunity to test my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript alongside my studies. The Pleasure gallery site displays a piece of artwork cut up into 12 squares, with each square linking to its respective SoundCloud mix.
