# Pleasure Gallery Website

Pleasure Gallery is a personal project completed in my free time outside of iO Academy. It is a replica of [this wordpress site](https://pleasuregallery.net/) which I made prior to the course. The site displays a piece of artwork cut up into 12 squares, each one links to a different SoundCloud mix. I wanted to test my skills in HTML, CSS & JavaScript by making the site again from scratch.
